                    <img id="self-photo" src="./images/outside-adventures-min.jpg"><p>My name is Nathaniel Stokes, you can call me Nathan if you prefer. I was born and raised in southwest Missouri, basically the center of the United States. Although I haven't done a lot of travelling, while I was in junior high and the first years of high school I found friends all over the world through this chatting website called "Chatango", which was mainly used for "RP" sites.</p>
                    <p>I had a friend in Yorkshire England, we both had a friend in India (although where exactly I do not know), and of course I had a lot of friends all over the country. That was probably the start of my real computer learning, since before that it was mainly just building computers to play games on. In the RP community computer knowledge was pretty prevalent since we were all pretty musch social outcasts.</p>
                    <p>I started coding in junior year of high school, learning Java. After that I learned HTML from a web development course in high school as well. Learned C++, C#, and assembly just for the fun of it. I started a data science bootcamp with TripleTen earlier last year where I learned how ridiculously intuitive python was to pick up. Now I'm working on personal projects and completing a real degree to provide for my 3 children and wife.</p>
